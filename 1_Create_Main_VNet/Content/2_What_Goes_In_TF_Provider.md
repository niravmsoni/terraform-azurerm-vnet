# What goes within a TF Provider?

- What goes in a TF Provider?
    - Versioned
        - All providers are versioned
    - Providers have data sources
        - Information that can be pulled from provider about target environment
        - Ex: Pull list of marketplace images OR Get existing VNet etc.
    - Resources
        - Resources that can be created in a target environment (Azure VM)
    - Modules
        - Most providers have modules that help us easily deploy common configurations for that provider. They can be found on registry
    - Authentication
        - Support various authentication mechanisms to interact with Provider
        - With Azure, we use Azure AD to provide that authentication
        - Different ways to authenticate with respect to Azure AD
            - Azure CLI
                - Using az login, TF will be able to find those credentials and use them when invoking provider
            - Managed Service Identity
                - Managed Identity can be assigned to objects that run within Azure
                - For ex - If we have a VM within Azure and TF runs within it, we can assign MI to that VM and not AzureCLI for authentication
            - Service principal with client secret (Username and pwd)
                - Usename and Password
                - Create service principal in Azure AD and a client secret and use those 2 to authenticate to Azure AD
            - Service principal with client certificate
                - Username and generated client certificate for authentication
